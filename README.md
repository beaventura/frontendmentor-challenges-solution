## Challenge Accepted

This is my own source code version I did with the Easybank Challenge from [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io). Since, its my first time using SASS what I did was to code along with youtuber Coder Coder who help beginner web developers learn basic front-end coding. In this source code also I did some a little tweak as I code along with Coder Coder and I learn a lot during the tutorial.
